            Working toward the same goal via two different methods has earned me a new appreciation
            for web design and the different ways people approach it. GitHub Pages and WordPress are
            two powerful tools, each with their own pros and cons.
        </p>

            GitHub offers complete control and customization of your page, with the only caveat being
            that you have to be fluent in HTML, CSS, and Git commands. HTML isn’t terribly difficult
            to learn. It’s no walk in the park, but it’s nothing compared to the challenges of CSS,
            which was my biggest obstacle starting out. There are so many styling rule options with
            CSS that deciding which ones will work best for your page can be difficult. Not to mention
            actually implementing them into your page, only to find you weren’t even close to being
            correct, then having to backtrack through your newly written code to figure out what your
            issue is. Rinse and repeat a few dozen times, and you have a visually appealing website
            tailored to suit your preferences and needs.

            On the other hand, WordPress offers a streamlined approach with an emphasis on
            user-friendliness, in exchange for creative control. Everything is (mostly) a preset or a
            premade template, which you can directly type in or insert pictures into. This makes it
            incredibly easy to add and reorganize content. As a beginner, the most daunting task in
            WordPress was simply navigating the menus and finding out where each tool and function
            was.

            WordPress is the path of least resistance, and although it made creating a website
            fast and easy, I prefer GitHub over WordPress. GitHub’s customization is unmatched, and
            the fact that I have to spend more time learning and going over code isn’t a drawback. In the future, I plan to learn more
            about containers and CSS properties, such as Flexbox, in order to optimize my Pages for
            mobile.
