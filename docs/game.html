                Dwarf Eats Mountain is essentially a god-like, citybuilder clicker game. The game is beautifully simplistic and follows a rudimentary formula. You buy housing to get dwarves, use dwarves to get money, and use money to get more weapons and you use weapons to get money.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Where the game truly shines is the customization and resource allocation. What I mean is, eventually you'll get to a point where you have enough money to buy anything, except housing. The late stages of the game will have you grinding for upwards of 30 minutes to afford one singular housing unit.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                These units provide 2 dwarves each, making manpower one of, if not the most precious resource in the entire game. The biggest challenge in the game is deciding where you'll send your dwarves to, and once you assign them to a station, it's permanent. It's almost impossible to buy enough housing units to fully man every station, at least without the help of prestige points.

                Dwarf Eats Mountain is super replayable. You can choose to end a run and in return, receive one prestige point. You can exchange prestige points for perks, which provide unique benefits like a certain amount of gold upon every restart, or bonus dwarves for consuming a certain amount of mountains.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another factor of the game's replayability comes from the man power issue. Without any prestige perks you can only max out about one or two stations, while maintaining your sanity. Each playthrough offers something new, as you max out a different station from the last.

                Overall I'm not a huge fan of clicker games, but Dwarves Eats Mountain is a worthy exception. The game easily has upwards of 10 hours of play time before you discover all its quirks and secrets.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you're looking for a slow paced yet entertaining game, I'd easily recommend Dwarf Eats Mountain. In my unprofessional opinion it gets an 8/10.
