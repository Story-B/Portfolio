        <p class="analysis-box"> By observing these word clouds, we can see that James Monroe used the words “Spain” “savages” “tribes” and “power” multiple times each. From this we can deduce that there was likely conflict with another group. Buchanan's cloud shows the words “people” “great” “free” and “domestic” multiple times each, this could lead us to believe the country was more focused on internal affairs.

            The State of the Union word clouds above highlight how Monroe was most likely 
            focused on expansion while Buchanan was focused on internal affairs. Monroe's 
            use of words like “invasion,” “territory,” and “force” make it apparent that 
            he was focused on expanding America's borders and that he wasn't opposed to 
            using strength to do so. Buchanan, on the other hand, seemed to shift his 
            focus toward the economy. This is evident in his use of the words “gold,” 
            “silver,” and “banks,” which suggests his administration was dealing with 
            issues of financial stability and internal economic pressure.

        <p class="analysis-box">This 4 gram analysis mostly backs up the previous ideas that Monroe is concerned with foreign issues, and Buchanan is domestically focused. Monroe mentions the country of Spain and their government a combined total of 6 times. Additionally, Monroe says “At the mouth of” twice, this is likely referring to a geographical location of interest, perhaps one that he had hoped to acquire. In contrast, Buchanan's 4 grams have no mention of foreign countries, instead focusing on discussing the constitution, which is mentioned 8 times. This idea that Buchanan is more domestically focused is reinforced by the fact he mentioned “defense” 4 times.

        <p class="analysis-box">
            This 4 gram analysis of 2 State of the union addresses differ thematically from each president's other speeches. Monroe doesn't seem to zero in on any specific topic. Monroe mentions the principles of our government 4 times, this could indicate that he is discussing general judiciary guidelines. Buchanan, for the first time in this analysis, mentions another a foreign republic, which is Honduras. Buchanan's address seemed to focus on current issues, with “slavery”, “reports to the secretary” and “fiscal year” being mentioned.

            Monroe's Key Words in Context view shows that he's mostly focused on the United States involvement with foreign countries. Further analysis reveals that Monroe could have been discussing the acquisition of territories by means of war. This is supported by the lines “The control of the United States over them should be complete and undisputed”. Similarly, Buchanan's speech also highlights a focus on war. Lines like “a military road through the Territories of the United States over which men and munitions of war may be speedily transported” suggest he was discussing practical war plans.

        <p class="analysis-box">
            Monroe's State of The Union address focuses on the wellbeing of the country. This is supported by Monroe's mention of neutrality in other countries' wars. Monroe mentions the national debt and in the same line states “peace is the best time for improvement”. This seems in contrast to his themes in his inaugural address. Buchanan's State of the Union address primarily focuses on the US involvement in other countries. He mentions that American business in Paraguay have had their land seized. Another focus of Buchanan's is the economy. His first 3 KWIC lines mentions the banks and national debt.
